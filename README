xosview uses GNU autoconfig. In general, you should be able to build
by following these steps:

  $ ./autogen.sh    # only required if building from repository
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

Edit Makefile.config for your setup, if you wish to change anything
from the default settings, such as the optimization flags. This of
course, should be done before one runs make.

Please see the README file for your platform for any special
instructions for running xosview on that platform.

See the man page for information on the xosview display and how to
customize it.

See the COPYING file for licensing terms.
